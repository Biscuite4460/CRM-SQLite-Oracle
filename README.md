# CRM-SQLite-Oracle
The application is an advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that was originally designed to function exclusively with SQLite. It has been adapted to also support Oracle databases, including integration with Oracle Wallet for enhanced security. The core of the application is based on a CRM demo that was initially built to demonstrate capabilities with SQLite. Enhancements include the ability to generate reports using FastReport, a powerful reporting tool, and expanded database compatibility to include both SQLite and Oracle. This adaptation allows for greater flexibility in managing database solutions and supports more complex data management and security needs in business environments.
